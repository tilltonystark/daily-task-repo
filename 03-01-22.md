> 5 Lessons from Atomic Habits 
- Small habits leads to big change. Habits are the compund interest of self-improvement.
- Focus on system and not on goals. Goals are about the end result while system is the process that get to those results.
- If you want to change your habit, then focus on who you wanna be rather what you want to achieve. Who(Identity) -> How(Process) -> What(Outcome)
- Follow the 4 laws of behaviour change, make it a) Obvious, b) Attractive, c) Easy, d) Satisfying
- Be patient. To see meaningful result. Our habit need to persist for long enough.
