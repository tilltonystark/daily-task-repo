```It's not a good idea to create a Startup, just because you wanna create a startup. 
Create a startup because you want to solve a problem that keeps you up at night.

Optimizely :Hard Work, Know your customer and their need, Standup again after you failed
Locket :It's an experiment. So, you should try everything you know with every resource you 
have and if that doesn't work, think about something new & something better.
